# User Guide

Welcome to Shut Up and Run! This guide will help you get started and make the most of your AI-powered running companion.

## 1. Getting Started

### Signing Up / Logging In

## 2. The Dashboard

The Dashboard is your daily hub for all things running. It's personalized based on your profile, active training plan, and real-time information.

Here's what you'll find:

*   **Current Date**: Clearly displayed at the top.
*   **Motivational Greeting**: A fun, running-related pun and greeting to start your day.
*   **Weather Insights**:
    *   A summary of the day's weather for your location.
    *   A recommendation for the best time to run based on temperature, chance of rain, and wind.
*   **Today's Workout**:
    *   If you have an active training plan, this section shows your scheduled workout for the day.
    *   If you don't have an active plan (or your plan has ended), the AI will suggest a suitable workout based on your profile preferences.
*   **Dress Your Run**: Detailed, itemized clothing suggestions based on the weather conditions at the recommended running time.
*   **Running News & Updates**:
    *   Top running news stories tailored to your preferences (if set) and location.
    *   Notifications related to your training plan (e.g., if your plan has recently ended).

The dashboard content is cached daily. It will refresh automatically after midnight (in your local timezone) or if you update relevant settings in your profile (like location or news preferences).
